    <h1>Major Takeaways</h1>
      <strong>How the web works:</strong>
      <p>There are three major components that makes the web work.</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li><em>Client</em> - computer and browser. Like the one I'm typing on.</li>
          <li><em>The Internet></em> - Nuff said.</li>
          <li><em>Servers</em> - big computers that store whole bunch of info.</li>
          <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Here is a good video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQQA8RpKxqg">servers.</a></li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
      <strong>HTML:</strong>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language.</em> All web pages are built on HTML and that's why it's important <br>
          to learn.
        </p>
      <b>Tag and Elements:</b>
        <p>HTML documents are made up of HTML <b>elements.</b> When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of element by <br>
          using HTML <b>tags</b>. Here is an unrealted <a href="http://espn.go.com/">link</a> to espn.
        </p>
      <b>Computers are stupid:</b>
        <p>There is a really <strong>cool</strong> way we explain why computers are stupid to kids.  I heard this on a podcast once. Have a<br>
          teacher pretend to be a <em>computer</em> that has to make a PB and J sandwhich. The teacher takes literal orders from the kids and <br>
          makes a mess of things.  The kids <b>learn</b> that telling a computer to make a sandwhich is a complex and detailed task.
        </p>
      <br>
      <b>Inline vs Block Elements:</b>
        <p>
          HTML elements are either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>.  The difference is that <em>block</em> elements have an "invisble box" around them <br>
          used to format the element.
